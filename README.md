clustering text data (data mining fall 2019)

## NOTE
- `present.html` is created using revel.js
- `topic_modeling_big.ipynb` uses more data for LDA than `topic_modeling.ipynb`. But it still cannot handle very large data (e.g. 1M)

## TODO
- [x] big data LDA (still less than a million samples)
- [x] visualize results LDA
- [x] big data neural models (check k-means time)
- [x] find optimum number of clusters for neural models
- [x] visualize results neural models

## write up
see `text_clustering.pdf`
